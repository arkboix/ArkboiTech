    <h3><i>Date: 7/12/2024</i>| How to install and set up Linux Mint 22</h3>


        <pre>
            <b># What we'll be doing</b>

            Today we are going to be installing and setting up Linux Mint 22 "Wilma", which as of late 2024 is the
            latest version of Linux Mint.

            Linux Mint is know for being user friendly and highly stable, so I recommend following this tutorial if
            you want to get started with Linux.

            <b># What we need</b>

            There are some stuff that we need in order to install Linux Mint.

            > An active internet connection
            > A USB Drive, with atleast 30GB Space
            > A hard drive with atleast 50GB Space (I Recommend a 64GB+ Drive as the minimum)
            
            <b># Preparation</b>

            Sow, now we need to prepare our Linux Mint Installation Medium.

            An Installation Medium allows us to install Linux Mint to our system.

            Go to <a href="https://linuxmint.com" class="amain">linuxmint.com</a> and click download. You will
            get to choose what edition/flavour of Mint you want, select Cinnamon, since it's the most modern flavour.
            You will be asked to choose from the download mirrors after you select your flavour/edition, choose the country that
            you live in, or if not available, choose the country closest to you, otherwise select a link from the world mirrors.
            Then it will download the .iso file for Linux Mint.

            Now, we need to download a tool to burn our downloaded .iso file to our USB Drive.
            and that tool, is Rufus, which you can download from <a href="https://rufus.ie" class="amain">rufus.ie</a>

            You can choose the latest version to downlaod and once downloaded, open the .exe file.

            In Rufus, if your USB Drive is plugged into your computer, it will automatically detect it, if not, please ensure
            that the Drive is connected properly.

            Under the "Device" section with your USB Drive in rufus, you should see the option to select an iso, click the
            select button.

            Now, you can select your downloaded .iso file.

            <b>WARNING: Before you start to burn the .iso file, backup any data on the USB, as it will be completely formatted and erased.</b>

            Now click the start button below, to start the process.

            Once finished, DO NOT click the start button again, click the close button.
            Also, if prompted to download anything when clicking the start button, say yes.

            <b># Booting into the Installation Medium</b>

            Now that our USB Drive is ready, let's boot into it. Make sure to backup any important data in your current system,
            and then, search in your desired search engine (google, bing, duckduckgo), for your motherboard manufacturer's BIOS key.

            To put it simply:

            For laptop users search: {laptop_company_name} laptop BIOS key
            For PC users search: {motherboard_company_name} BIOS key

            The BIOS key can be: DEL, F12, ESC, F2 etc

            Once you got your BIOS key, restart your computer.

            When the screen turns on, press or press repeatedly , your BIOS key.

            Now, setting up everything in BIOS is something I can't help in, because each BIOS is differnet,
            but just do this:

            Look for "Boot", "Boot Order", or "Boot Device"
            If there is a category that says boot, go to the category/tab, and look for boot order, or boot device.
            If you found boot order, in there use the keys that should be mentioned somewhere in the BIOS, to change the boot order,
            and make sure your USB Device is at the top.

            For boot device, just select your USB Drive

            Now, look for secure boot, it should be in the boot tab/category if there is one.
            Select it, and disable it.
            If there is an option to clear all secure boot keys, do that aswell.

            Now, look for save changes and exit, and select it.

            Your computer will continue to boot, but this time, into your USB Drive

            There should be some options, such as:

            Start Linux Mint 22

            Select that option.

            <b># Installing Linux Mint</b>

            You will boot into what's called a live environment.
            You can either test out and play around with Linux Mint, but remember this:

            This testing area is running on a USB drive, it's a live environment, if you reboot,
            everything you did resets

            So it's recommended to just open the "Install linux mint" file on the desktop.

            This will launch the installer.

            You need to select the language you want to use in the installer. Then click continue.
            Now, select your keyboard layout. It is set to EN_INTERNATIONAL/US QWERTY by default.

            Once it is selected, click next.

            You will be asked to choose your timezone, select it and click continue.

            Now, if you are asked for the partitioning, choose "Install alongside Windows Boot Manager" to dualboot.
            Or Erase disk to erase the entire disk. Erasing the disk will delete windows.

            now, if asked to install multimedia codecs, check the option, since it is very useful.

            Now you will be asked for the user details. enter your name, the computer's name, your username, and
            choose a password.

            The additional options are: Require my password to sign in or log in automatically, encrypt my home folder

            Select require my password over log in automatically, and if you have a laptop, check the encrypt my home
            folder option, so if your laptop get's stolen, they won't be able to access your files.

            Now, click install, and wait for about 2 minutes, it should be done in 2 minutes, but when done, click restart now.
            If asked to "remove installation medium, and then press ENTER", disconnect the usb drive and press enter.

            Congratulations! you have installed Linux Mint!

            # First Boot

            Now, you will boot into linux mint, and here's how to set everything up!

            First of all, if you see a welcome screen, then just close that out we're gonna be doing everything 
            manually, so first of all, we need to update our system, for that you open the terminal, and don't be scared it's just 2
            commands, and here are the commands you need to type.

            <div class="command"><code>sudo apt update</code></div>

            you will be prompted to type your password, while typing, you can't see it on screen 

            <div class="command"><code>sudo apt upgrade -y</code></div>

            Now, wait for that to finish, and once it's finished, you're done updating.

            <b># Aesthetics and more</b>

            Now, we can theme out and customize our system. feel free to add apps to the panel (taskbar),
            change the position or size of the panel, change the background in system settings, change the theme, get a
            new theme, it's al stuff that you can easily do.

            Also in themes, click advanced theme options to change icons, cursors, window borders, etc, and get new themes.

            You can also install programs, either from the terminal or the software manager, here is the terminal commands to intsall a program.

            <div class="command"><code>sudo apt install {program-name-(usually smallercase, and hiphens instead of spaces)}</code></div>

            and then, you can also try out some of these commands that i recommend:

            <div class="command"><code>sudo apt install thunar</code></div> - Installs Thunar, an easy file manager
            <div class="command"><code>sudo apt install vim</code></div> - not for beginners, but cool text editor
            <div class="command"><code>sudo apt install code</code></div> - install vscode
            <div class="command"><code>sudo apt purge firefox | sudo apt install google-chrome</code></div> - remove firefox and add google chrome

            And yeah, that's just only a few things out of the many things you can do, and now, you could try, installing a different desktop environment, but that's
            for another articles, and have fun in your new system!
