        # An Alternative

        Linux is an open source, free alternative to Windows & Mac. And Windows, and Mac,
        and Linux aswell all of these are Operating Systems

        In-order to use a computer, or any other device like, a phone efficiently.
        Both Windows & Mac are paid operating systems.

        You may say that windows is free, but that's because of:
            > You never actually tried to download it.
            > You never actually licensed it, and instead pirated it.
            > You installed windows with a local account on your PC that already had windows,
            and then signed in with your account, but you saw no activation problem, because that account,
            was also signed in, in your other windows system that you just either formatted, or decided to dualboot,
            and that actually fixes any activation problem.

        But, windows, it's actually about a hundred bucks for an activated license, and Mac, it only ships
        with a VERY expensive device (The MacBook) and the only other way to use MacOS, is "Hackintosh"
        which, setting up a MacOS system on a non-macbook PC actually isn't free cause you'll need very
        specific hardware,

        But linux, you just go to a website, click download, flash it to a USB Drive, install it, and boom,
        you have linux now.

        Some people, may hate linux, cause, they don't know how to use the terminal, or use any open source alternative
        to an app. But to be honest, you don't need insane tech knowledge to install linux, and also, don't, if you ever try linux,
        don't install Ubuntu, some people may say, it's very beginner friendly, but now with all of the stuff that Canonical
        (the company that made ubuntu)
        is doing, i recommend an Ubuntu based distro, or, just Fedora Linux.

        And, by the way, Ubuntu, Fedora, Distros, i'll explain all of them:

        # Distro:

        Linux, is not something with only one main version (I don't mean like v1 or v2, but like:)
        MacOS BigSur and MacOS Sonoma. Linux, is just a kernel, a kernel is the Core of the operating system,
        kind of like: if linux was a house, then the foundation is linux and the interior exterior, furniture, that's
        the distro or distubution. Main ones are: Debian, Arch, Fedora. There is Ubuntu, based on debian, and a whole
        bunch of distros based on Ubuntu, same goes for arch, but not a lot of arch-based distros out there, and fedora,
        fedora is fedora, nothing else, other than RHEL or Redhat Enterprise Linux, the linux distro that.. owns fedora?

        Redhat is a company, that actually sells their distros, but don't you worry, fedora is free,
        but the Redhat Linux for Enterprise a.k.a RHEL is not free, and it's a whole article worth of stuff that
        i'll need to cover inorder to explain RedHat and Fedora, and CentOS, not gonna talk about CentOS right now cause,
        it's just distros for Enterprises.

        # Ubuntu

        Canonical, Snap, AVOID Ubuntu, it's, Canonical is trying to make Ubuntu different from others like, snap,
        a "Package Manager", which you use to install apps and other stuff. And, Snap, is just slow and overall, bad.

        So if you ever want to actually try out Linux, or get started with it, i'd say you need to use Linux Mint,
        or, just use Fedora, and I really don't recommend Fedora as your first distro, i'd say, you can start out with mint,
        and then use Kubuntu which is a flavour of Ubuntu, it does have snap but most of the time you can use APT, which also comes
        pre-installed, just, Kubuntu offers that customizability, and then you can go down the paths of Fedora, the ones i don't recommend are:

        > Manjaro Linux (You get some packages with unfinished versions, and some with the oldest versions)
        > Ubuntu (Snap, and Canonical just trying to make Ubuntu like windows, just locked down)
        > Arch (you have to install it through the terminal, and manually set it up)
        > Debian (Stable Release (doesn't break) but don't expect daily updates)
        > Pop!_OS (Just breaks + I don't really like that PopOS tries to make linux look like not linux)

        And these distros, you should avoid. <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Another thing you want to avoid are these Google Searches,
            or any Search with these keywords:
        </span>

        > Best linux distro 2024
        > Best linux distro for Gaming
        > how to install linux
 
        So, a lot of websites, "TechRadar" honorable mention, just spit out distros and useless features like:

        "Driver Support"

        Just understand this: Distros don't come with "Driver Support" because they are already supported in the
        kernel itself! The Linux kernel is the thing that has stuff like drivers!

        and i'd just say, do any of those searches you like, but at the end, put:

        <div class="command"><code>site:reddit.com</code></div>

        this basically shows results from reddit only, and reddit, you can find some nice actual solutions out there.

        And Linux, is also known for the freedom that you get from it, you can make your linux look like
        anything you want it to look and feel like.

        You can go to reddit to see other user's customizations.

        # Desktop Environments

        Desktop Environments are the Graphical Interface of a linux distro, kinda like, how windows, has the taskbar, the start menu, 
        all of that stuff comes with the desktop environment. You can customize them, and tweak them according to your liking, but a few desktop Environments
        do not allow a lot of customization, but this is just my opinion on a few popular ones:

        KDE Plasma 5: Good for customizability, and also pretty stable. A little hard to do all of the customizations i think.
        KDE Plasma 6 and higher: Really good customizability, easy to do anything, theming, stable.
        GNOME: Not very customizable, modern MacOS like look, extensions and user themes that make it a little better.
        Cinnamon: Very lightweight, Very modern, Kind of customizable (more customizations than gnome, but less than Plasma)

        and yeah, Fedora comes with GNOME, that's why i said i'm switching to the KDE Plasma version of Fedora, also,
        GNOME, is supposed to be pronunced "Guh-Nome"

        and that's desktop environments,

        and also, that's linux!

        Now, there are some extra stuff I want to quickly go through with a short description:

        <b>Hyprland</b>

        Very customizable window manager, window managers are desktop environments, but for a more keyboard only,
        hotkey experience, and hyprland is a tiling window manager, meaning it keeps your windows clean and organised, very
        hard to set up though.

        <b>i3</b>

        Also a window manager, comes with a auto-generated configuration and easy to use.

        <b>Terminal Commands</b>


        Install a program:
        <div class="command">
        <code>
        sudo apt search {program-name}
        sudo apt install {package-name}
        </code>
        </div>

        Create a file in the current directory:
        <div class="command"><code>touch {filename.fileextension}</code></div>

        Create a new directory:
        <div class="command"><code>mkdir /{name}</code></div>

        List the directory we're currently in:
        <div class="command"><code>ls</code></div>

        Go to a different directory:
        <div class="command"><code>z {directory-full-path}</code></div>

        So, that's just the tip of the iceberg, there's still more to cover, and for that, try reading other articles, where i talk about
        my own personal Linux experience.
