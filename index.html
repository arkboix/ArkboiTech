        # Kubuntu: Better than Ubuntu?

        Kubuntu is the (linux) distrubution that i personally use, and i think it's way better than Ubuntu, because of a whole lot of things:

        > Kubuntu has the (KDE) Plasma Desktop Environment, which is highly customizable
        > It's super fast
        > Everything is user friendly because of:
            > (APT) package manager
            > (Ubuntu) Flavor
            > (KDE) Plasma
            > It's (K)ubuntu

        And after all you can make it look like whatever you want to, and it's just so good

        # Problems with Kubuntu

        Personal:
        I (recently) had problems with Wi-Fi where it would be 0b/s after a while, and i'm trying to fix it,
        maybe the problem is:

            >Network drivers
            >Updates
            >(or) Something else

    I will put an image of my Kubuntu Desktop below this (hopefully)

        # Alernatives for popular applications

        A whole lot of popular applications that we may or may not use on a daily basis are not compatible
        with linux, such as (Photoshop, Premiere Pro, MS Office (et cetera)), and that's why most linux distros suggest alternatives,
        and most of them are made by the community, and also Free and open source. Today i'll cover a (few) of them and also
        talk about why most of them are bad as in a content creator's perspective.

        ## Photoshop (to) GIMP

        Photoshop is a very popular photo editing program developed by Adobe, used by a lot
        of people, however it is not available on Linux, so what? We got GIMP,
        (GNU Image Manipulation Program) and it's (supposed) to be an alternative
        to Photoshop, but oh boy, as a "Certified Pro Photoshop Guy that never used it",
        GIMP is bad, very bad, every simple thing in photoshop is converted into Something
        insanely hard in GIMP, most features don't exist and it's just more for those who really
        don't want to do much other than some basic color correction

        Now; An Alternative to an Alternative to photoshop

        Photopea <a href="https://photopea.com">(Go to photopea.com)</a>, is a much better alternative
        to photoshop that's usable on the browser, it's like a one to one copy
        of photoshop, but is free and on the web meaning most of the code can be seen,
        and it's also very easy and also very similar to photoshop, and i use it
        personally, and i think it's very good!

        In the next update, i'll discuss more open source apps in Linux, but this is it for now!
