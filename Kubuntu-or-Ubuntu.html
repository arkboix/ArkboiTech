        # Kubuntu: Better than Ubuntu?

        Kubuntu is the (linux) distrubution that i personally use, and i think it's way better than Ubuntu, because of a whole lot of things:

        > Kubuntu has the (KDE) Plasma Desktop Environment, which is highly customizable
        > It's super fast
        > Everything is user friendly because of:
            > (APT) package manager
            > (Ubuntu) Flavor
            > (KDE) Plasma
            > It's (K)ubuntu

        And after all you can make it look like whatever you want to, and it's just so good

        # Problems with Kubuntu

        Personal:
        I (recently) had problems with Wi-Fi where it would be 0b/s after a while, and i'm trying to fix it,
        maybe the problem is:

            >Network drivers
            >Updates
            >(or) Something else

    I will put an image of my Kubuntu Desktop below this (hopefully)
