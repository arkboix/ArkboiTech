        # What we'll be doing

        We will install Arch Linux, with the "Archinstall Script" that makes the
        installation very simple, and automated, and we'll also cover how to dualboot arch linux and
        windows on one single drive.

        # Preparations

        First, let's prepare the Arch Linux install medium USB Device. for this, you'll
        need to take your USB stick and plug it into your computer, and then go to <a href="https://archlinux.org">Archlinux.org</a>
        and go the download section. Scroll down until you see mirrors and download from a mirror
        that's from your country/closest to you. (You'll need an active internet connection for this
        because the filesize as of the time of writing is 1.1GB)

        Once downloaded, go to <a href="https://rufus.ie">Rufus.ie</a>, and download the latest
        version of rufus, you can search <a href="https://youtube.com">Youtube</a> for tutorials on
        how to install a program.

        Open Rufus once installed and say yes to the User Account Control prompt is asked.

        Your USB Drive should automatically be detected. Click the select button below and select your
        downloaded .iso file. then click the start button, and once done, click the close button.

        Now, let's resize our drive so that we can dualboot. Go to your search menu and search for
        "diskman" or "diskmgmt" (both are the same thing). An app called "disk management" should be the
        first result. Open it.

        In disk management, you should see Disk 0 and Disk 1 (Disk 0 is your main drive and Disk 1 is your
        USB Drive)

        In Disk 0, you should see 3 partitions (As 3 sections), an EFI Partition first, a Windows/Local Disk partition
        and a Recovery partition

        We need to shrink the system partition (It should be called windows or local disk) which is inbetween
        the EFI and recovery partition.

        Right click it and select "Shrink Volume".

        A window should pop up. Click next to proceed, and you will need to enter the amount of shrink space in MiB
        this shrink space is the space we will give to Arch Linux.

        Here are some presets for the shrink space:

        100GiB = 102400 MiB
        200GiB = 204800 MiB
        300GiB = 307200 MiB
        400GiB = 409600 MiB

        Then click next, and your disks are configured. The black section in Disk 0 is
        unallocated space that we will use for our Arch System.

        # installation

        Now go to your search engine of choice, we'll do <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> for now,
        and search for your BIOS key.

        The BIOS key has to be pressed to enter BIOS when booting up.

        To find your BIOS key, search:

        <div class="command"><code>{Your Motherboard Company} BIOS Setup key</code></div>

        Now, restart your system, and when the screen turns on, press your BIOS key.
        Sometimes you may need to press it repeatedly

        You should enter your BIOS, or for HP Users who pressed esc, press F10 to enter
        BIOS.

        In the BIOS, there should be instructions for navigating it, but try to find the
        following:

            "Boot" tab, or "Boot Device" or "Boot Order"

        For HP Users, go to the Boot tab and in Boot order make sure USB/Flash drive is at the top
        , use f6 and f5 keys to change it.

        For other users, set the boot device to your USB drive.

        Now, save & exit your BIOS

        When booting, you should see a screen with a few options, with on of the being:

            Arch linux install medium

        Select that option (Which should be the one automatically selected)

        Once booting into Arch, you will see a Konsole (terminal) interface after
        it has loaded up.

        You can type commands in the Konsole.

        Inorder to make the konsole text huge, type this command:

        <div class="command"><code>setfont ter-132n</code></div>

        now, let's connect to the internet, which we can do with these commands:

        <div class="command"><code>iwctl</code></div>

        IWCTL allows us to connect to our networks, once you type iwctl, type these commands:

        <div class="command"><code>station wlan0 get-networks</code></div>

        This will show all available Wi-Fi networks.

        <div class="command"><code>station wlan0 connect "{Wi-Fi name}"</code></div>

        please replace {Wi-Fi name} with the name of your wi-fi and enter your password

        To test connectivity, type this command:

        <div class="command"><code>ping google.com</code></div>

        you should get repeating replies from google.com, press Ctrl + C to exit this loop.

        now, let's format our disks.

        press Ctrl + L to clear the terminal and type this command below, which will
        list all of our disks.

        <div class="command"><code>lsblk</code></div>
        
        you should get a list of disks. now do the following commands:

        <div class="command"><code>fdisk -l</code></div>
        <div class="command"><code>cfdisk nvme0n1</code></div>

        The "nvme0n1" may be "nvme0n1p1", this can be viewed in lsblk.
        now, you should get a list of partitions in your Disk

        you will see "Free Space" as well, the free space with the size of the
        size we shrinked our windows drive is the free space we will format.

        Navigate to the free space using arrow keys.

        Make sure to select it with Space

        Make sure the "new" action is selected from the different buttons at the bottom
        (use left and right arrows)

        press enter, and you need to enter in the space for the new partition, we need two partitions
        to install arch, an EFI partition and a Linux Filesystem partition.

        when asked the size for the new partition, remove anything already there, and instead type
        1G, this is 1 Gigabyte for the EFI System

        Once created, make sure the new partition is selected, and select the Type action from the buttons
        below. Enter to select the type of the partition

        Use arrow keys to navigate and once "EFI System" is highlighted, press enter
        to choose it.

        Now select the free space and select new again, this time, the maximum size for it should automatically be
        typed, don't delete that, just press enter, it is the size of our Filesystem

        it should be "Linux Filesystem" by default, if not change the type to Linux Filesystem

        Once everything is done, select the write button at the bottom.

        please remember the partition name of our newly created partitions.

        Press to enter to confirm and write the partitions

        then choose Exit.

        now let's format our partitions.

        type lsblk, and your partitions will appear.

        Our linux partitions usually will be the last two ones, that is usually
        nvme0n1p5 (efi) and nvme0n1p6 (filesystem)

        type this command to format the EFI partition:

        <div class="command"><code>mkfs.fat -F32 nvme0n1p5</code></div>

        And then the Filesystem:

        <div class="command"><code>mkfs.ext4 nvme0n1p6</code></div>

        now let's mount the drives, starting with the filesystem:

        <div class="command"><code>mount nvme0n1p6 /mnt</code></div>

        now create a directory for the EFI system:

        <div class="command"><code>mkdir /mnt/boot</code></div>

        Mount the EFI system:

        <div class="command"><code>mount nvme0n1p5 /mnt/boot</code></div>

        Alright, now we have set up our partitions. You can type lsblk to ensure the parititons are mounted.
        The filesystem partition should have /mnt and the efi partition /mnt/boot next to it

        # Install Archinstall

        In order to use the archinstall script, we need to install archinstall and the archlinux-keyring. for that,
        type this command:

        <div class="command"><code>pacman -Sy</code></div>
        <div class="command"><code>pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring archinstall</code></div>

        You may be prompted to proceed with the installation, type "y" to continue.
        Once it is installed, launch archinstall with:
        
        <div class="command"><code>archinstall</code></div>

        you will get an interface that can be navigated with the arrow keys , the enter key, and the spacebar.

        This is all you need to change in there:

        Mirrors Category: press enter to open it and select your region's mirros, it's usually easy, just find your country.

        Partition/Disk Configuration category: open it and select "Pre mounted drives" and when prompted for the directory of the root partition, type
        "/mnt". If asked for the EFI partition, type "/mnt/boot"

        Users category: create a user, name it whatever you want, add a password, and when asked to be a super user, choose YES.

        Root Password: set a root (sudo) password, that you will use to do commands as root.

        Audio: choose pulseaudio

        Extra packages: choose essentials such as browsers, text editors, here's a template:
        
        <div class="command"><code>firefox nano vim gimp gwenview kdenlive</code></div>
