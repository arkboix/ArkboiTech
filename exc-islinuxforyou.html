    <h3><i>Date: 31/12/2024</i>| Is Linux for you?</h3>

    <pre>
    <b># What is Linux?</b>

    Okay, so here's a quick overview on Linux, it's free, doesn't cost more than $100 or a macbook, you can view and modify the source
    code, but this doesn't mean you can just exploit it, there's a huge community who contributes to it instead of being owned by a corporation, and
    this crazy operating system was built by one man as a hobby (Linus Torvarlds)

    <b># Now, who should use it?</b>

    Well, it depends on what distro of Linux you use, if you are a beginner to linux, which is obvious, you're switching to Linux, you are a beginner,
    then my no.1 tip for you is to not be scared of what people would call "Advanced" distros like Arch linux, as a beginner, you'll think of arch as the final
    boss, but to be honest, it's just some baby steps to terminal knowledge.

    <b># What i'm NOT doing in this article</b>

    I'm not here to recommend you the best linux distro, it's your choice, there is not much difference between most linux distros, because there's something you need
    to understand, popular and industry standard linux distros like linux mint, pop!_OS, ubuntu, manjaro, nobara etc are all forks of the three main pillars of linux distros,
    and yeah, i made that up.

    So, these threee main linux distros are debian, arch, and redhat or fedora, the distro that is based on redhat, and used for desktop use instead of enterprise use like redhat.
    Basiaclly, use debian, or arch, don't go the redhat way, debian is not easy to install despite the quick graphical and text installation, and arch is.. arch!

    <b># Who are you to use linux?</b>

    If you are doing high quality production works like video editing with enterprise software like davinci resolve or premiere pro, then Linux is not for you,
    but let's say you do video editing or photo editing, more of as a hobby, then yeah linux IS for you, basically, if you want to create a movie, use windows or mac,
    and if you want to just do fun stuff and like having freedom over your computer, use linux!

    <b># And that's another point!</b>

    Freedom. You can make linux be like anything you ever imagine it to be, want a system inspired by half life, or a certain TV show, or maybe you want to recreate
    the macos look, but for free? Yeah! It's all do-able in linux, cause it was never a profit thing, linux doesn't exist to make money (maybe redhat does), it exists
    as an.. alternative, as a relief, to the evil corporations and their bad plans

    <b># If you want security</b>

    We got it! Linux has a market share of about 4% in late 2024 among other desktop operating systems, yeah, 4%!
    And that's why it's secure, nobody uses it, so nobody makes a virus for it! And, since it's open source, a small little exploit
    in the code will be fixed within seconds of making it public!

    That's the beauty of linux, but if you're a terminal hating and fearing, privacy ignoring, freedom ignoring, ready to spent money on software person, you're
    better off with windows.
