		<b># Amazing!</b>

		I recently tried out Fedora KDE and I said that everything broke and i uninstalled it
		in my previous article. And I also said, i'm using Linux Mint, once and for all. And I still am.

		It's been a few days since i've got Linux Mint, and setting everything up, was very fun, so
		the thing i'm most proud about is my terminal, kitty, and I made it look translucent, with nice
		colors, launch neofetch on startup and say a message while starting up all of that stuff by customizing
		kitty's configuration files and by .bashrc

		So for those who don't know what a bashrc is, it's basically a file with code that will execute
		everytime when you launch any bash terminal.

		I also changed Neofetch's configuration to change the image that pops up when using neofetch, because
		the default one is an ascii linux mint logo which I don't really like.

		So, my terminal is the thing I put the most amount of time into.

		Now, the anime picture is just a place holder alright, I just wanted to see how do you put an image in
		neofetch like that, and i'm gonna be replacing that with something else that fits this pink theme thingy.

		Now the whole reason I went with a pink theme is because my kitty terminal theme has a pink color,
		so I just decided to change everything to pink.

		<b># System Themes</b>

		So, is it just me or does the cinnamon "Mint-Y" theme look a bit outdated? Well, to me
		it defenitely looked outdated so I decided to watch "Michael Horn's" video about customizing
		mint, and I used the papirus icons and everything else, jasper gtk theme pink, and this miku-cursor
		i found.

		# That's it!

		And that is my linux mint experience! It was amazing, and I will keep using it!

		So, here are some quick info:

		Terminal: Kitty
		WM: Mutter(Muffin)
		DE: Cinnamon 6.2.9
		Files: Thunar
		Text Editor: Micro
		Theme: Jasper-Pink-Dark [GTK 2/3]
		Icons: Papirus-Pink-Folders

		And thanks for reading!
